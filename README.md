A Flutter app that acts as a client to [Encryptogram](https://encryptogram.co.uk), a new encrypted chat app.

## Testing

Remember to install [Dart](https://dart.dev/get-dart) and [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) first.

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/encryptogram/encryptogram`
2. Run `cd encryptogram`
3. Run:
    * `flutter run` to run on Android/iOS if one is setup for Flutter development, running without Android or iOS device connected will result in a selection menu to choose which platform you want to use
    * `flutter run -d chrome --web-port 8000` to deploy JavaScript natively compiled version to `localhost:8000`
    * `flutter run -d linux` to run on Linux
